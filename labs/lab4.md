*Make sure you write up in a lab report (as markdown file in your github page) about what you changed, why it is important to maintain good documentation, and what you have learned from this lab.


The link wasn't working so I reported it as a bug to FreeBSD.org 
It is important to maintain documentation because that is the best reference for developers to use in order to use your project in theirs. If there is bad documentation  developers are  less likely to use your project. This lab convinced me that I should document everything I do.
