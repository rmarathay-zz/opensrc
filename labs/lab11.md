#Lab 11

## Part 1

I installed Colloquy and did not see anyone actually doing anythin in the chatroom. There were people connected but no one actually took part in the conversation. 


## Part 2

When people actually participated in the conversation there was almost no structure other than the bot that would send its message to the group every now and then. I guess that is why forums kind of took off, because it allowed users to actually get pointed answers instead of a jumble of information that may or may not be correct.

The TitanPad web application seems to be a less relevant Facebook Messenger
