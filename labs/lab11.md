#Lab 11

## Part 1

I installed Colloquy and did not see anyone actually doing anythin in the chatroom. There were people connected but no one actually took part in the conversation. 


## Part 2

When people actually participated in the conversation there was almost no structure other than the bot that would send its message to the group every now and then. I guess that is why forums kind of took off, because it allowed users to actually get pointed answers instead of a jumble of information that may or may not be correct.

The TitanPad web application seems to be a less relevant Facebook Messenger

#### Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.
Asynchronous communication happens at the same time, similar to a chatroom. This type of communication can be confusing and information can get easily confused or lost. Further, asynchronous communication is similar to email because it requires a response to continue with the conversation. This can be seen in Socket.io, a framework that is used in conjunction with Node.js to build real-time chat applications. In order to make the application realtime it requires that certain call backs are made to different function calls.

#### Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction
HCI requires that framework allows humans to interact with a particular computer program. Individual interaction and group interaction is not remarkably different but does pose some challenges for developers. In order to monitor multiple users in a chatroom the development team needs to keep track of all the messages that are being sent from each user to the server and then again from the server to the users.

#### Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.


#### Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.
