### 2
It is important to choose a license for your project because it helps protect your intellectual property and it details exactly how your software can be used and distributed. If you don't choose a license you could theoretically lose the rights to your software if someone sees it as problematic.

### 3
If you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license you won't know exactly how the creator expected you to use their software. If you violate there terms of use then you could end up in the same position as Jesse from Chapter 3.
