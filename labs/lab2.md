It is important to choose a license for your project because it helps protect your intellectual property and it details exactly how your software can be used and distributed. If you don't choose a license you could theoretically lose the rights to your software if someone sees it as problematic. Furthermore, it is common courtesy to provide a license for software that is made for the public, as it is important to protect the rights of the owner and explicitly tell the users of that software what limitations are placed on them.

If you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license you won't know exactly how the creator expected you to use their software. If you violate there terms of use then you could end up in the same position as Jesse from Chapter 3. Also, it is problematic when as a developer, you augment that software to your needs because if the software doesn't have a license it definitely cannot be altered without the creator's explicit permission.

### 4
I do agree with this claim because hyperlinks and user interface is typically what draws the masses to a particular framework or service. In the case of Gopher, it lacked intuitiveness and as a result 


### 5
Microsoft .NET Core uses the MIT license because it lets users do pretty much anything with the library as long as there is some reference to the original creator, who in turn cannot be held liable for any issues resulting from using that software.

### 6
My project will be a Swift framework for location based purchases and user data collection having to do with payments and location. I'm going to pick the Apache License 2.0

### 7

Developer: MIT License
  The MIT License protects the original creator and makes users of the software include a copyright as well as a license to their work. Developers can augment this license to their liking but in its very core it allows people to use their software but requires that the developer gets credit for their work.

Company: Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)
  The Apache License 2.0 makes users of the software document any changes as well as includes a copyright and a license to the organization's or individual's work. The documentation of changes to the software is important because it allows the organization to keep track of a feed of all the changes and can at anytime make changes to their original code base.

Common Good: GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)
  The General Public License v3 is the perfect license for the common good because it allows users of the software to modify and distrubute the software but also requires any changes of the software to be documented. The documentation requirement makes it useful to the general public so that future users can not only see what the software evolved from but also track the changes that users contribute to the code base.

Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.

The customers for my swift-geo software will be developers that are using native iOS frameworks to build their own applications. The framework will allow developers to quickly get location data of merchants and potential users that use their application with this framework. It will also record Apple Pay transactions along with other statistics and data that might be useful to iOS application developers. I will choose the Apache License 2.0 for this project to protect my intellectual property as well as give access to this software for other to use.

Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects - create a table which project has which license. for example:

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
https://github.com/wtg/shuttle_tracking_2 | Yes | MIT License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
https://github.com/rpiml/okcollege-web-client | Yes | MIT License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon | YES | MIT License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
